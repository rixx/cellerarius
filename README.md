# Cellerarius

Cellerarius helps me plan big baking undertakings, particularly before Christmas. Planning, baking, and then shipping
cookies for 40+ packages and 60+ people has a lot of moving parts and I got tired of making spreadsheets by hand.

## Project status

There is nothing here yet. This repo is public because I'm adopting a "working in public" approach with this project,
tracking my plans and thoughts in issues.
